Developers engineered the CMS interfaces to be easily usable by any user, most likely with the standards outlined by Usability.gov.  As a web designer, it is important to have a high-level understanding of how some of the most popular content management system works, and why some might be more important than others according to users’ particular needs. 
As a web designer for a SAAS startup company, I am often working with multiple content management systems, and analyzing their importances. 
Outlined below, I have compare some of the top three popular CMS’s on the net- Wordpress, Squarespace and Wix, and have made my own audit of why each come with their own share of pros and cons, that make it worthwhile from a personal, business, and client-facing perspective. The goal is to choose the best platform for our work, as well as the work for our clients.
