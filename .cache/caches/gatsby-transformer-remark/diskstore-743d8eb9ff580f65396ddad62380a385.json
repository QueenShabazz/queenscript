Social media is a different digital “hang out” spot, where users are often consuming multiple streams of content and information. Your social media strategy should have awareness on engagement trends by platform- how you engage with your customers on Facebook should be different to how you communicate with them on Instagram, and how you share information on Twitter. \nFinally, blogging is a great middle ground between email and social media.
