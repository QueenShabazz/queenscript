>What Does SEO Stand For?

SEO is an acronym, which stands for Search Engine Optimization. SEO is essentially all about making a website better to be read and found by search engines. You might be wondering, what does it mean to be optimized for search engines? The answer to this critical question of being search engine optimized is shared with many entrepreneurs and small businesses alike. The major search engines on the internet include Google, Bing, and Yahoo. However, when SEO professionals talk about what it means to be search engine optimized, they are usually referring to a website’s performance as assessed by Google.  

>Why Is SEO Important?

According to Google’s Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Starter Guide, “Search engine optimization (SEO) is often about making small modifications to parts of your website… [which] could have a noticeable impact on your site's user experience and performance in organic search results. ” Essentially SEO is all about the way a website is built, and its performance and ability to be found on the web. 

>How Does SEO Work?

Some of the key terms around SEO include: index, crawler, and the Googlebot. The index of a website can understood as storage. The index is where Google and the other search engines store information about your website’s web pages, and describes the content, as well as URL address of each page on the website. Google essentially finds each page on your website, reads through the process of crawling, and adds it to the index that is displayed in search results.  

>Think About Building a Strong SEO Practice 

The crawling process supports displaying information to users about their search. Google and other search engines look for web pages that are new or updates, and add them to the search index. Having a website that is SEO friendly is crucial in being found on the web. As the internet grows larger with more content added to it, literally every second, it is important for small businesses, and entrepreneurs alike to know how to stand out amongst the crowd. Adding keywords, making sure that the site is accessible to screen readers, and building a fast performing site are all part of having a strong SEO strategy for your website.
