Such digital traffic is an indicator to how well your business is doing on the web. It is also a good measure for your marketing efforts, and ultimately supports lead generation. Website traffic will also allow services like Google Analytics to measure your website’s performance when users enter your site, including calculating bounce rates and exit rates, to help you determine what content works well for your customers. </p>\n<p>Not All Web Traffic Is Created Equal</p>\n<p>There are two main streams to generate traffic: free and paid. The traffic on your website supports Search Engine Optimization (SEO), by helping increase your rank in the search index. Essentially, the more users searching for your website, and entering your website, the higher on the list you will be ranked when a user searches for sites like yours in a search engine like Google.com. </p>\n<p>From Traffic to Engagement</p>\n<p>There’s one particular caveat to this digital traffic paradigm, however. Engagement on your site is just as important as the traffic to your site. If you have a high bounce rate (meaning many users might land on your site, but immediately close out the window and do not revisit your site), this will have a negative impact on your SEO. Ways to increase conversion into better conversion is to include buttons with call to actions, forms that capture leads in the right parts of your site, and making a usable navigation that will allow users to get to the information they need, seamlessly.  </p>\n<p>The Top 3 Channels You Can Leverage to Build More Web Traffic, Engagement, For Free</p>\n<p>There are so many ways to approach increasing your website’s traffic and engagement. Often, there is not a one-size-fits-all approach, because it is heavily driven by your industry, the customers in your industry, and the way information is accessed and delivered in your industry. </p>\n<p>Email is a channel that can support increased traffic and engagement.</p>\n<p>Newsletters are a commonly used way that businesses engage with customers, outside of their own websites. Links to your website and call to actions in the body of your emails are tools that drive users back to your site, where they will more likely be engaged with the content that they “previewed” in the body of the newsletter you shared with them.</p>\n<p>Similarly to email, social media can support directing your customers back to your site with the content that you share. Social media is a different digital “hang out” spot, where users are often consuming multiple streams of content and information. Your social media strategy should have awareness on engagement trends by platform- how you engage with your customers on Facebook should be different to how you communicate with them on Instagram, and how you share information on Twitter. </p>\n<p>Finally, blogging is a great middle ground between email and social media. Blogs hold a lot of information  is a great way to share information that your customers are seeking, while also promoting your website. </p>"}
