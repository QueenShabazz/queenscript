As a member of the instructional staff at the U.C. Berkeley Extension, I meet a lot of people who are interested in learning how to start coding, and need guidance on where to start understanding web technologies.

Queenscript takes a documentation-based approach at learning web development. All of the information that you will need to work on web technologies will be in the documentation, usually found at the website where the technology can be downloaded. The full documentation can be found on the[ W3C Recoomendation Documentaion for HTML 5.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/). Specifications about [HTML5 can be found by clicking here](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#abstract). 

## Tags
According to documentation, HTML documents are "[trees] of elements and text". Each element is called by a tag, and cannot be overlaping. 
## Attributes
## Semantic HTML for accessibility
